===========
HamlReloader
===========


Easiest reloader ever.

1) Run without arguments to read and generate to same directory

``` hamwatch ```

2) Run with arguments for source / target spec.

``` hamwatch my_sass/ my_css/ ```

- OR -

``` hamwatch . rendered/ ```

CLI outputs generated path on change.

Boom. That's it.
